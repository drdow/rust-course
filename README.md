# Rust Learning Course by Days

Welcome to my **Rust Learning Course** repository! 🎉

This project serves as a structured approach to mastering Rust, organized into **21 days of focused learning**.
Each day is represented as a standalone executable project (`bin` crate) within a Cargo workspace. By working on different tasks daily, I aim to achieve a solid understanding of Rust's core concepts and practical applications.

## 📝 Purpose

The primary purpose of this repository is to:

- Document my **self-paced journey** of learning Rust.
- **Experiment with different features** of the language and its ecosystem.
- Build **practical projects** that reinforce my understanding.
- Ultimately, **gain proficiency in Rust** for real-world application development.
